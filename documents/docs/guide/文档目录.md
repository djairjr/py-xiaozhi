# py-xiaozhi document directory

This directory contains all functional documents of the py-xiaozhi project, divided by functional modules for easy review and use.

At present, mcp has been fully transplanted, with built-in horoscopes, marriage, system functions, 12306, online query, what to eat today (recipe recommendations), countdown timer, online music, and vision (three methods of Xiaozhi's official vision, Zhipu, and Ali)
Other modules can be expanded and enabled according to needs.

The current project has enabled the v2 authorization protocol, and the wss link is returned through the ota interface. Both the official Xiaozhi and the open source backend have aligned the authentication process.

**Role definition added: Prioritize the use of external extension tools (mcp\iot), do not be lazy and not execute
In this way, mcp or iot will not be executed, but there is still a probability of triggering the same function of the system. At this time, you may need to prompt it**
