## 2. `externally-managed-environment` (macOS)

### **Error description**

```
(.venv) huangjunsen@huangjunsendeMac-mini py-xiaozhi % pip install -r requirements_mac.txt -i https://pypi.tuna.tsinghua.edu.cn/simple

error: externally-managed-environment

× This environment is externally managed
╰─> To install Python packages system-wide, try brew install
    xyz, where xyz is the package you are trying to
    install.
    
    If you wish to install a Python library that isn't in Homebrew,
    use a virtual environment:
    
    python3 -m venv path/to/venv
    source path/to/venv/bin/activate
    python3 -m pip install xyz
    
    If you wish to install a Python application that isn't in Homebrew,
    it may be easiest to use 'pipx install xyz', which will manage a
    virtual environment for you. You can install pipx with
    
    brew install pipx
    
    You may restore the old behavior of pip by passing
    the '--break-system-packages' flag to pip, or by adding
    'break-system-packages = true' to your pip.conf file. The latter
    will permanently disable this error.
    
    If you disable this error, we STRONGLY recommend that you additionally
    pass the '--user' flag to pip, or set 'user = true' in your pip.conf
    file. Failure to do this can result in a broken Homebrew installation.
    
    Read more about this behavior here: <https://peps.python.org/pep-0668/>

note: If you believe this is a mistake, please contact your Python installation or OS distribution provider. You can override this, at the risk of breaking your Python installation or OS, by passing --break-system-packages.
hint: See PEP 668 for the detailed specification.
```

### **Solution**

1. **Installation using virtual environment**
   ```sh
   python3 -m venv my_env
   source my_env/bin/activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
2. **Use **``** for global installation**
   ```sh
   brew install pipx
   pipx install package_name
   ```
3. **Force installation (not recommended)**
   ```sh
   pip install package_name --break-system-packages
   ```

## 3. `WebSocket connection failed: BaseEventLoop.create_connection() got an unexpected keyword argument 'extra_headers'`

### **Error description**

```python
# Establish WebSocket connection
self.websocket = await websockets.connect(
    self.WEBSOCKET_URL, 
extra_headers=headers # In higher versions, this is changed to additional_headers=headers
)
```

### **Solution**

- **New version**``: `extra_headers` changed to `additional_headers`.
- **Old version**``: `additional_headers` changed to `extra_headers`.

## 4. `Default input/output audio device not found`

### **Error description**

```
AudioCodec - ERROR - Failed to initialize audio device: [Errno -9996] Invalid input device (no default output device)
AudioCodec - WARNING - Unable to initialize audio device: [Errno -9996] Invalid input device (no default output device)
```

### **Solution**

1. **Windows**:

- Enable microphone and speakers in **Sound Settings**.

2. **Linux/macOS**:

   ```sh
   pactl list sources | grep "Name"
   ```

3. **Check available audio devices**:

   ```python
   import pyaudio
   p = pyaudio.PyAudio()
   for i in range(p.get_device_count()):
print(f"Device {i}: {p.get_device_info_by_index(i)['name']}")
   ```

4. **Manually specify audio device**:

   ```python
   stream = p.open(format=pyaudio.paInt16, channels=1, rate=16000, input=True, input_device_index=0)
   ```

## **5. `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named '_tkinter'` Common on mac m4 and below **

### **Error description**
```
(.venv) apple@appledeMac-mini py-xiaozhi % python main.py

Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/Users/apple/Desktop/py-xiaozhi/main.py", line 5, in <module>
    from src.application import Application
  File "/Users/apple/Desktop/py-xiaozhi/src/application.py", line 23, in <module>

    import _tkinter  # If this fails your Python may not be configured for Tk
    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named '_tkinter'
```

### **Solution**

1. **Install `tcl-tk`**
   ```sh
brew upgrade tcl-tk # Generally the first step is enough
   ```

2. **Check Homebrew’s `tcl-tk` path**
   ```sh
   brew info tcl-tk
   ```

3. **Reinstall Python and link with `tcl-tk`**
   ```sh
   brew install python-tk
   ```

4. **Manually specify the `Tcl/Tk` path (if necessary)**
   ```sh
   export PATH="/opt/homebrew/opt/tcl-tk/bin:$PATH"
   export LDFLAGS="-L/opt/homebrew/opt/tcl-tk/lib"
   export CPPFLAGS="-I/opt/homebrew/opt/tcl-tk/include"
   ```

5. **Recreate the virtual environment**
   ```sh
   python3 -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## 6. `Failed to import opuslib: No module named 'pyaudioop' or '_cffi_backend'`

### **Error description**

Failed to import opuslib: No module named '_cffi_backend'
Please ensure that the opus dynamic library is installed correctly or is in the correct location
```

### **Solution**

1. **Python version compatibility issues**
- This error is usually related to Python version, especially Python 3.13 version
- It is recommended to use Python 3.9-3.12 version

2. **Reinstall cffi**
   ```sh
   pip uninstall cffi
   pip install cffi
   ```

3. **opus.dll placement**
- Make sure you have opus.dll in the correct location (project root directory and System32 directory)
   ```sh
# Check if copied to these locations
   C:\Windows\System32\opus.dll
Project root directory\opus.dll
Project root directory\libs\windows\opus.dll
   ```

4. **Install pyaudioop support library**
- For 'pyaudioop' errors, try downgrading the Python version or installing related dependencies
   ```sh
   pip install pyaudio
   ```

```

### **Solution**
- Recommended python version is 3.9 - 3.12

1. **Make sure `numpy` versions are compatible**

`numpy==2.0.2` There may be build problems. It is recommended to try to install a more stable version:
   ```sh
   pip install numpy==1.24.3
   ```

If you don't need a specific version, you can install the latest stable version:
   ```sh
   pip install numpy
   ```

2. **Install compilation tools**
   
Windows users may need to install Visual C++ Build Tools:
   ```sh
#Install Microsoft C++ Build Tools
# Download and install: https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/visual-cpp-build-tools/
   ```

3. **Use precompiled wheels**
   ```sh
   pip install --only-binary=numpy numpy
   ```
